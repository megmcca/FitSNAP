### Automated testing with pytest

`pytest` find files and functions containing the `test` phrase, and executes them. 

For example, the functions in `test_examples.py` are run via GitHub Actions with
`FitSNAP/.github/workflows/pytests.yaml` when pulling or pushing to the master branch. As seen in 
`pytests.yaml`, the name of this action is `tests`, which is why we see a "tests passing" badge on 
our main repo page if the tests were successful.

### Testing locally

We can manually perform these tests locally. 

**You may have to ensure that your `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` and PYTHONPATH are properly set**.

For example:

    python -m pytest -s test_examples.py::test_fitsnap_basic

will run the single proc non stubs test for the Ta linear example. Adding the `-s` python will allow 
you to see screen output from prints, for the purpose of debugging or designing your own tests. 

To perform PyTorch tests locally:

    python -m pytest -s test_pytorch.py --disable-pytest-warning
