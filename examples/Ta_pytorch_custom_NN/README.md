### PyTorch neural network force fitting example.

Fit a NN with

    python -m fitsnap3 Ta-example.in --overwrite # use --overwrite if you want to overwrite existing
fitsnap files.

This also creates corresponding plots of errors vs. epochs and target force vs. model force. 

To check that the model forces match those calculated with finite difference, do 
`python fd_force_check.py`, which creates a `fd_force_check.png` plot. 
This finite difference script uses the same force calculation routine that we use in 
`fitsnap3lib/lib/neural_networks/pytorch.py`

When fitting forces AND energies, it was found to best have `energy_weight=1e-2` and 
`force_weight=1.0` or some similar ratio.

### Calculating fitting errors.

FitSNAP produces output files that we can use to calculate error ourselves. To do this, run

    python calculate_fitting_errors.py

which will calculate mean absolute errors for energy and forces, as well as plot a distribution of
force errors, for the training and validation sets.
