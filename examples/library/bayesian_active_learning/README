[GENERAL]
active_learning: default = True, whether to select structures based on some criteria or just randomly (if you want to benchmark against random selection)
number_of_iterations: default = 10, number of times to select new structure(s) and retrain model
batch_size: default = 1, number of structures to select per active learning loop (iteration)
cluster_structures: default = False, whether or not to cluster structures before selecting which to add to training set
output_directory: default = the working directory that the script is ran in, controls what directory all the output files are written into

[OBJECTIVE]
E_weight: default = 1.0, weight to apply to energy uncertainties when combining in objective function
F_weight: default = 1.0, weight	to apply to force uncertainties when combining in objective function
S_weight: default = 1.0, weight	to apply to stress uncertainties when combining in objective function
F_aggregation_function: default = None, an optional aggregation function to apply to forces in each structure, options are name of any numpy function e.g. mean, median, max
S_aggregation_function:	default	= None,	an optional aggregation function to apply to stresses in each structure, options are name of any numpy function e.g. mean, median, max
objective_function: default = sum, how to combine (possibly aggregated) energy, force, and stress uncertainties for each structure, options are sum, max, average
weight_by_relative_DFT_cost: default = True, divides each structure by its number of atoms cubed to approximate DFT cost of calculating that structure

[VASP]
VASP_executable_path: default = /projects/vasp/2020-build/clusters/vasp6.1.1/bin/vasp_std, path to the VASP executable
VASP_kpoints_auto_generation_Rk: default = 30, density of auto-generated kpoints grid, reasonable values can be as low as 10 for large gap insulators or as high as 100 for metals; see https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/KPOINTS
[element]_POTCAR_location: no defaults, path to each elemental POTCAR for each element in your dataset

[PLOTTING]
plot_uncertainty_error_correlation: default = False, makes normal and loglog plots of the absolute errors (if known on the unlabeled set) vs the std_dev of the prediction (sqrt of our prediction variance - 'uncertainty' in the code)
plot_convergence_plots: default = True, makes plots for the E,F,S mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) of the training and testing sets separately as a function of the # of training datapoints in each category
