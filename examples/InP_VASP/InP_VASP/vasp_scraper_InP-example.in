##      New optional parameter: vasp2json
##      Since OUTCARs can be very large files with a lot of extraneous text, the VASP scraper has an option to
##      to convert your VASP data to native FitSNAP JSON format. Though FitSNAP internally will see no difference
##      between your OUTCAR data and a converted JSON file, conversion allows your dataset to be easily transferred
##      between systems and/or uploaded.
##      This option has a default naming scheme to ensure that new JSONs are relatively unique. If "only_label" is
##      set to False (the default), the scraper will take the name of the final subdirectory containing the OUTCAR
##      file to create a label for newly-created JSON files. If "json_label" is specified,
##      If multiple ionic steps exist in the OUTCAR, each step will be extracted to a single JSON file and labeled
##      in sequence.
##      The newly-created JSON files have a comment line at the top with the full path to the original scraped
##      OUTCAR frile.
##      vasp2json options:
##      overwrite:      (bool) overwrites any currently-existing JSON files in the indicated group folder with
##                      the same name as ones being scraped. Default is False.
##      json_label:    (str) user can append a prefix to add information to the scraped file name.
##                      In the example input files, "vs" is used to indicate the JSON file was
##                      generated by the VASP scraper. Default is "vs".
##      only_label:    (bool) user can override default naming behavior and have all files labeled only using
##                      the given prefix above. Default is False.
