#### Using this package:
* [Required] This package expects a python 3.6+ version. Python dependencies: pandas scipy sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme psutil tabulate
* [Required] Compile LAMMPS (lammps.sandia.gov) as a shared library. Detailed instructions can be found in `usages --> Installation` section of the manual. If you can open python and run `import lammps; lmp = lammps.lammps()` and it succeeds, you should be good.
* [Optional] For optimal performance, also install your favored flavor of MPI (OpenMPI, MPICCH) and the Python package mpi4py. Note: if installing mpi4py with a Python package manager, we strongly recommend using pip over conda as pip will auto-configure your package to your system's defaut MPI version (usually what you used to build LAMMPS)
* [Optional] (Required for atomic cluster expansion, ACE, capabilities ) Along with compiling LAMMPS with all of the typical FitSNAP flags, turn the ML-PACE package on.
    * Clone the ML-PACE package with the implemented ACE descriptor computes into your build directory from: git@github.com:jmgoff/lammps-user-pace.git
    * Follow the README.md and INSTALL.md in this repo to build lammps with ACE descriptor calculators

#### Installing a minimal working environment with Conda:
* Clone this repository
* Add the cloned repository path to your PYTHONPATH environment variable (periodically `git pull` for code updates)
* Add conda-forge to your Conda install, if not already added \
    `conda config --add channels conda-forge` 
* Create a new Conda environment\
    `conda create -n fitsnap python=3.9; conda activate fitsnap;`
* Install the following packages:\
    `conda install lammps psutil pandas tabulate sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme mpi4py`
* WARNING: Conda lammps installation does NOT include ACE descriptor set or SPIN package needed for the corresponding examples.

#### Running:
* `(mpirun -np #) python -m fitsnap3 [options] infile` (optional)
* Command line options can be seen with `python -m fitsnap3 -h`
* Examples of published SNAP interatomic potentials can be found in `examples/`
